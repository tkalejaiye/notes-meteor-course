# Notes App

Simple web based text editor built on Meteor based off of Andrew Mead's Full Stack Meteor and React Course.

I plan on building on the app and making a minimalist online text editor.

## Getting started
This app requires you to have Meteor installed on your machine. Then, clone the repo and run the following

```
meteor npm install
```

```
meteor
```

## Running the Tests

To run tests, run the following command and view the reporter at localhost port 3000.

```
meteor npm test
```

You can simultaneously run the app by running

```
meteor run --port 3030
```

replacing 3030 with whatever port you want.
